BSD::Time README

This Perl module implements the BSD gettimeofday() and settimeofday()
functions.  They return and modify the time with subsecond accuracy.
Nominally the accuracy is one microsecond, one millionth of a second,
but in practice the accuracy may be not that accurate, maybe few dozen
microseconds.  Your operating system environment must of course support
the *timeofday() functions, Perl cannot fake them.
